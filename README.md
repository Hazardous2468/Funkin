# **Flashing lights warning!**


# An experimental fork of FNF dedicated to adding modchart support!
**By Hazard24**

A modified fork of the latest version of Friday Night Funkin' which allows the player to create and play modcharts in a very similar method to modcharting in NotITG with Mirin Template.

Do note that the aim of this fork is strictly focused on modcharting, it doesn't aim to fix any issues that may arise whenever the base game gets updated and breaks everything.

Eventually resources will be added here to help explain how to get started making your own modcharts, starting from basic beginner stuff all the way to the more advanced stuff. And of course, all of this is open source so you can just dive into the code and see what the hell is going on (though expect it to be a bit messy, I'm not the best programmer)

# What does it have?

Z Axis (3D) stuff, Arrowpath stuff, fancy holds, errr

A few demo songs, including whatever the fuck this is

Useful debugging stuff to aid in modchart creation

Note: If you're trying to compile the code yourself, you might need to grab the arrowpath image from a stable release to put into the assets folder (cuz idk how to modify assets folder here lol)
