# **Flashing lights warning!**


# An experimental fork of FNF dedicated to adding modchart support!
**By Hazard24**

A modified fork of the latest version of Friday Night Funkin' which allows the player to create and play modcharts in a very similar method to modcharting in NotITG with Mirin Template.

Note: If you're trying to compile the code yourself, you might need to grab the arrowpath image from a stable release to put into the assets folder (cuz idk how to modify assets folder here lol)
